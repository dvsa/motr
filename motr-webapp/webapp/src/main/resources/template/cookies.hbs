            <p>The MOT reminder service puts small files (known as ‘cookies’) onto
                your computer to collect information about how you browse the site.</p>

            <p>Cookies are used to:</p>

            <ul class="list-bullet">
                <li>measure how you use the website so it can be updated and

            <p class="govuk-inset-text">MOT reminder service cookies aren’t used to identify you personally.</p>

            <h2 class="heading heading-medium heading--medium">How cookies are used on the MOT reminder service</h2>
            <p>There are a number of different types of cookie used in the MOT reminder service which allow the system
            to work securely and consistently. These are:</p>

            <ul class="list-bullet">
                <li>Google Analytics cookies</li>
                <li>MOT reminder service application cookies</li>
                <li>Third-party cookies</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="heading heading-small heading--small">Google Analytics cookies</h3>
            <p>We use Google Analytics software to collect information about how you
                use MOT reminder service. Google Analytics helps us make the service better for its users.</p>

            <p>Google Analytics stores information about:</p>

            <ul class="list-bullet">
                <li>the pages you visit on the MOT reminder service</li>
                <li>how long you spend on each page</li>
                <li>how you got to the site</li>
                <li>what you click on while you’re visiting the site</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Google doesn't collect or store your personal information, for example your name
                or address, so this information can’t be used to identify who you are. We
                don’t allow Google to use or share our analytics data.</p>

            <p>Google Analytics sets the following cookies:</p>
