        <h2 class="heading-medium">How cookies are used on the MOT Reminders service</h2>
        <p>There are a number of different types of cookie used in the MOT Reminders service which allow the system to work securely and consistently. These are:</p>
        <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>Google Analytics cookies</li>
            <li>the MOT Reminders service application cookies</li>

        <h3 class="heading-small">Google Analytics cookies</h3>
        <p>We use Google Analytics software to collect information about how you use the MOT Reminders service. We do this to help make sure the site is meeting the needs of its users and to help us make improvements.</p>
